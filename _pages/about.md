# Research Interests & Specialties:
**Particle Suspensions in Viscous Fluids:** Analysis of anisotropic-shaped particle dynamics in viscous fluids for tunable flow properties in engineering and biomedical applications.
**Computational Modeling/Simulations**: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) & fluid-structure interaction (FSI)

# Career Summary:

### Graduate School 
I am a Chemical Engineering Ph.D. Candidate at [University of California, Davis](https://che.engineering.ucdavis.edu/) advised by [Dr. Harishankar Manikantan](https://manikantan.faculty.ucdavis.edu/research/). My current research focuses on examining the relationship between slender/elongated particles (biopolymers such as actin filaments /microtubules, paper pulp fibers, rigid nylon fibers, etc.) and the surrounding viscous fluid. For a brief summary of my projects, I worked on during graduate school, please visit my Projects/Portfolio Page! My major projects during my graduate studies are as follows:


1. **[Analysis of fiber-like particle bending in fluid flow:](https://github.com/ThomasMHNguyen/Non_Constant_K)** I developed a framework consisting of CFD-FSI simulations and image-processing techniques to quantify particle bending due to changes in the particle's mechanical properties.

2. **[Microfluidic Transport Dynamics of flexible fiber-like particles:](https://github.com/ThomasMHNguyen/Simple_Shear_Migration)** I researched and developed methods for CFD-FSI simulations to model and quantify particle transport dynamics in constricted flow geometries.

3. **Particle clogging and transport dynamics around Microfluidic flow bends (currently on-going):** I developed methods and algorithms to model the dynamics of rigid fiber-like particles and analyze their clogging properties around flow corners/bends in microfluidic devices.


### Before Graduate School
I obtained my B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering in 2017 from [North Carolina State University (NCSU)](https://cbe.ncsu.edu/) with an emphasis on Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Sciences. I developed technical skills associated with biologics manufacturing such as cell culture, protein chromatography purification, etc. I worked summer internships at engineering consulting/life science companies such as Integrated Project Services (IPS), Seqirus, and Biogen. 

After graduating, I spent 2 years at the [National Institute of Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/) in Baltimore, MD in the Laboratory of Immunology & Molecular Biology. My Principal Investigator was [Dr. Nan-ping Weng](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/nan-ping-weng). Utilizing bioinformatics techniques, I developed computational tools to process Next-Generation Sequencing data from methods such as bulk RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, scRNA-Seq, etc. Additionally, I employed statistical, and data science techniques to determine how the immune system changes with aging.
