title: "Logitudinal Study of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells"
excerpt: "I developed a data processing pipeline to convert RNA-Seq data to matched \\(\alpha\beta\\) TCRs from 30 human patients across 7 years. I also developed a suite of statistical and data science analysis tools to determine how the TCR repertoire changes with aging and across the 7 year gap."
